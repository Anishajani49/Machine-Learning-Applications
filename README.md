## Projects

### 1. üìä Netflix Data Analysis with Tableau
- **Description**: This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Netflix data. The dashboard provides insights into trends, popular genres, and user preferences.
- **Skills Used**: `Tableau`, `Data Visualization`
- **Highlights**:
  - Created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and patterns in Netflix's library.
  - Included filters and parameters to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

### 2. üå≥ Decision Tree Classification on Bands Dataset
- **Description**: This project involves implementing a decision tree classifier to analyze the bands dataset. The project focuses on predicting categorical outcomes based on various input features, demonstrating the effectiveness and interpretability of decision trees in classification tasks.
- **Skills Used**: `Python`, `Decision Trees`, `Data Preprocessing`
- **Highlights**:
  - Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical data.
  - Trained a decision tree classifier and tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
  - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### 3. üîç K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. The KNN algorithm is applied to the [Dataset Name] to predict categorical outcomes based on feature similarity.
- **Skills Used**: `Python`, `KNN`, `Data Preprocessing`, `Model Evaluation`
- **Highlights**:
  - Processed and normalized the dataset to prepare it for KNN analysis.
  - Trained the KNN model and experimented with different values of `k` to find the optimal number of neighbors.
  - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.

### 4. üå≤ Random Forest Classification on Play Tennis Dataset
- **Description**: This project involves implementing a Random Forest classifier to analyze the [Dataset Name]. The Random Forest algorithm is used to predict categorical outcomes by building multiple decision trees and combining their results for more accurate predictions.
- **Skills Used**: `Python`, `Random Forest`, `Data Preprocessing`, `Model Evaluation`
- **Highlights**:
  - Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
  - Trained a Random Forest classifier, tuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees, and evaluated model performance.
  - Assessed feature importance to understand which variables had the most impact on the predictions.

### 5. ‚öñÔ∏è Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification on Pulsar Data
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the [Dataset Name]. The SVM algorithm is used to classify data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.
- **Skills Used**: `Python`, `SVM`, `Data Preprocessing`, `Model Evaluation`
- **Highlights**:
  - Preprocessed the dataset, including feature scaling and encoding of categorical variables, to ensure it is suitable for SVM.
  - Trained an SVM model with different kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) and tuned parameters such as `C` and `gamma`.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
